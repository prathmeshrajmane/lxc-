LXC

it is an open source container platform 
used for managing containers



cgroups - limits the resources which a process or set of processes can use these resources could be CPU,Memory,Network I/O or access to filesystem

Namespaces - provides process isolation, complete isolation of containers, separate file system.

There are 6 types of namespaces:
1. mount ns - for file system.
2. UTS(Unique time sharing) ns- which checks for different hostnames of running containers
3. IPC ns - interprocess communication
4. Network ns- takes care of different ip allocation to different containers
5. PID ns - process id isolation
6. user ns- different username(uid)
